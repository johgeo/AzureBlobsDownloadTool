# AzureBlobsDownloadTool
### Purpose?
A practical use of this tool os to fetch all images from azure storage for use locally to for instance match a production backup restored locally. But really any blobs on azure blob storage could be fetched assuming you point it to the correct blob container.

Tool will list availbale containers for the connected account
